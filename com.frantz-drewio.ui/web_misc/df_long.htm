            <time datetime="10/01/2005" class="end">October 2004</time>
            <p>Lead software engineer/architect on the 16 member Rational XDE Modeler front-end team.  Responsibilities include design, development and enhancement of the XDE Modeler user-interface. The XDE Modeler user interface is logically partitioned into 3 distinct pieces the extensibility service, the shapes service and the shell/IDE services. As lead engineer I have contributed significantly in each of these areas and I have been a member of this team since the project was started in 1999. Most recently I have been involved with performance tuning various algorithms and infrastructure in the shape services, which have improved things such as diagram load time by a factor of 2 since the XDE 1.0 release.  Transitioned to Sr. Software Engineering role on the Rational Software Architect team in March 2003 and continued working on this until October 2004. I am well versed in the product development life cycle and what is required to take a product from concept to shrink-wrap.

 			<h2>Senior Staff Software Engineer, Rational Software</h2>
 			<p>Lead software engineer of VSM 7.0 UI team (10 engineers), the team is responsible for designing and building the next generation user interface for Rationals UML modeling tool (Rose and VSM). This product VSM 7.0 is slated to ship as part of Microsoft Visual Studio 7.0 (VS.Net). This project has also provided me the opportunity to work closely with not only my Rational team members but also with Microsoft engineers and product managers. The VSM product was the basis for what is now known as XDE Modeler and after my work on the VSM team I transitioned to a similar role on the XDE Modeler front-end team where I became lead engineer/architect for the XDE modeler. XDE Modeler 1.0 that shipped in late 2000. During my tenure on VSM and XE Modeler 1.0 my responsibilities have included the design and or construction of a number of the components and features within the user interface. The user interface component of XDE Modeler includes the following areas: drawing surface shapes/connectors, active-x control wrapping, UI extensibility, UI error handling, interface with the rational model server and UML meta-model, interface with the various host shells (vs.net and eclipse), selection container, model explorer, property browser, command handling and various other user interface related widgets. I have made significant design and coding contributions in many parts of the user interface and also spent a certain percentage of my time focusing on UI performance tuning
